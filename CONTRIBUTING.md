# Contributing guidelines

This document provides guidelines for contributing to the Ops Actions project.

## üí° Requesting changes

[Open a new issue](https://github.com/equinor/ops-actions/issues/new/choose).

## üìù Making changes

1. Create a new branch. For external contributors, create a fork.

1. Make your changes.

   Follow our [best practices](./docs/best-practices.md) for creating reusable workflows.

1. Commit your changes.

    Use the [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) specification for semantic commit messages, where scope is the name of the updated workflow file.

    For example, if you've updated the `terraform.yml` workflow file:

    ```plaintext
    feat(terraform): skip Apply if no changes present
    ```

    If you've updated multiple or no workflow files, don't specify a scope:

    ```plaintext
    refactor: update workflow input descriptions
    ```

    If you've updated no workflow files, use the `chore` type:

    ```plaintext
    chore: update OIDC script
    ```

1. Create a pull request to merge your changes into the `main` branch.

    Use the Conventional Commits specification for semantic pull request titles.

## ‚úÖ Reviewing changes

1. Ensure all changes follow our [best practices](./docs/best-practices.md).
1. Check if there are any **breaking changes** that will require users to update their workflow calls:

     - Add required input or secret.
     - Update input type.
     - Update output value.
     - Rename input, secret or output.
     - Remove input, secret or output.
     - Rename workflow file.
     - Remove workflow file.

1. Ensure that the PR title follows the [Conventional Commits specificiation](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) and is using one of the following allowed types:

      - **feat:** add or remove something (e.g. workflow, input, job, step or output)
      - **fix:** fix something broken
      - **refactor:** change something without adding, removing or fixing anything
      - **docs:** document something
      - **ci:** change CI/CD setup (e.g. non-reusable workflows or scripts)
      - **chore:** everything else

1. Audit third-party actions:

      - Ensure commits are signed by trusted users (e.g. members of trusted organizations such as `actions`, `hashicorp`, `docker` or `Azure`).
      - Perform a static security test (e.g. using [StepSecurity Action Advisor](https://app.stepsecurity.io/action-advisor)).

1. Ensure that the workflow has been tested to work as expected. GitHub Actions workflows can be hard (if not impossible) to test locally. At a bare minimum, a workflow should be explicitly tested in a separate repository.
